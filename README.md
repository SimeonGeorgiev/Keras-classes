This is is a repository with several classes that I've written while working on kaggle datasets.

Min_Max.py: constraint that can be used be passed to Keras layers as a bias_constraint or kernel_constraint parameter.

Softmax_regularizer.py: sparsity regularizer for softmax layers.

Stacked_AE.py: Provides a way to define stacked autoencoders for pretraining, variational learning, denoising and so on.
